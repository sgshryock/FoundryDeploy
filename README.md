# Foundry VTT Server

Run your own Foundry VTT server on a Linux machine.

> **⚠️ Local Network Only**
> This setup is designed for **local network use only** (home networks, LANs). It uses self-signed SSL certificates and stores credentials in local files with standard permissions. Do not expose this server directly to the public internet without additional security hardening (proper SSL certificates, firewall configuration, VPN access, etc.).

> **📦 Physical Machine or VM Required**
> This setup is designed to run on a **physical Linux server or virtual machine**, not inside a Docker/LXC container. It installs and manages system services (nginx, Docker) that require:
> - systemd for service management
> - Direct access to `/etc/nginx/` and system configuration
> - Root/sudo privileges for system-level changes
>
> **Best for:** Raspberry Pi, spare computer, cloud VM (DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS EC2), Proxmox VM, home server
>
> **Not suitable for:** Running inside Docker containers, Proxmox LXC containers (without advanced configuration), or other containerized environments

## Requirements

### Minimum
- Linux server (Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 11+, Fedora, or Arch)
- 2 GB RAM
- 10 GB free disk space
- Docker 20.10+
- Docker Compose v2+
- nginx (installed by setup script)
- openssl (installed by setup script)
- A Foundry VTT license and account
- **User account with sudo privileges** (for nginx configuration)

### Recommended
- 4 GB RAM
- 50 GB free disk space (for modules and worlds)
- SSD storage for better performance
- Stable internet connection

## Setup

**Prerequisites:**
- You must have sudo privileges on your server
- Your user must be in the `docker` group (setup script will check and instruct if not)

1. Copy the `setup` script to your server
2. Run these commands:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
./setup
```

**Important:** Run `./setup` as a normal user (NOT with sudo). The script will prompt for your password when it needs elevated privileges for nginx configuration.

**Note:** You can run `./setup` from anywhere:
- From your home directory: `~/setup`
- From the FoundryDeploy directory: `cd ~/FoundryDeploy && ./setup`

Both work the same way!

The setup script will:
- Install any missing software
- Download the server files
- Ask for your Foundry account details
- Start the server

**To update:** Simply run `./setup` again. It will:
- Automatically update itself to the latest version
- Check for repository updates and pull if available
- Prompt you to use existing configuration or reconfigure
- Pull latest Foundry version if "release" tag is used
- Rebuild containers if needed

**Re-running setup is safe!** If you have an existing installation:
- Press Enter (or type 1) to keep your existing configuration
- Your credentials and settings will be preserved
- No need to re-enter anything

## Daily Use

**Start the server:**
```bash
./start
```
The start script will automatically check for authentication errors and provide clear instructions if your Foundry credentials are incorrect.

**Stop the server:**
```bash
./stop
```

**View server logs:**
```bash
./logs
```

**Uninstall Foundry:**
```bash
./remove
```
This script will:
- Stop and remove all Foundry containers
- Remove deployment files (compose.yml, start, stop, logs, remove)
- Prompt you to keep or delete:
  - **Foundry VTT software and all data** (worlds, modules, systems, assets, config)
  - **nginx configuration and SSL certificates**
- Always preserve the setup script for easy reinstallation
- Preserve settings (.env) if you keep data, delete it if you delete data

**Note:** If you keep your Foundry installation and data, the next time you run `./setup` it will:
- Use your existing Foundry VTT and data without redownloading
- Use your existing settings (.env) without asking for credentials again

## Accessing Foundry

Open your web browser and go to the address shown after running `./start`.

Example: `https://myserver.local`

**Note:** You'll see a security warning due to the self-signed SSL certificate. Click "Advanced" and "Proceed" to accept the certificate. This is normal for local network servers.

**Hostname Options:**
- **System hostname (recommended)**: Uses mDNS, works automatically on local network
- **Custom hostname**: Requires DNS configuration (like Pi-hole) to resolve
- **IP address**: Always works, but harder to remember (e.g., `https://192.168.1.100`)

## Updating Foundry

### Easiest Method: Re-run Setup

The simplest way to update everything:
```bash
./setup
```

This will automatically:
- Check for repository updates
- Pull the latest Foundry image (if using "release" tag)
- Rebuild containers if needed
- Use your existing configuration (no need to re-enter credentials)

### Manual Update to Latest Version

If you prefer manual control:

1. Edit `.env` and ensure `FOUNDRY_DOCKER_TAG=release`
2. Pull the new image:
```bash
docker compose pull
```
3. Restart the server:
```bash
./stop && ./start
```

### Manual Update to Specific Version

To switch to a specific Foundry version:

1. Edit `.env` and change `FOUNDRY_DOCKER_TAG=12` (or desired version number)
2. Pull the new image:
```bash
docker compose pull
```
3. Restart the server:
```bash
./stop && ./start
```

## Backup and Restore

### Backup Your Data

Create a backup of your Foundry data:
```bash
# Create backup directory
mkdir -p backups

# Backup Foundry data volume
docker run --rm \
  -v foundrydeploy_foundry_data:/data \
  -v $(pwd)/backups:/backup \
  alpine tar czf /backup/foundry-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz -C /data .

# Backup configuration
cp .env backups/env-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

### Restore from Backup

Restore your Foundry data from a backup:
```bash
# Stop containers
./stop

# Restore data volume
docker run --rm \
  -v foundrydeploy_foundry_data:/data \
  -v $(pwd)/backups:/backup \
  alpine sh -c "cd /data && tar xzf /backup/foundry-backup-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz"

# Restore configuration
cp backups/env-backup-YYYYMMDD .env

# Start containers
./start
```

### Automated Backups

Set up daily backups with cron:
```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line for daily 2 AM backups
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/FoundryDeploy && docker run --rm -v foundrydeploy_foundry_data:/data -v $(pwd)/backups:/backup alpine tar czf /backup/foundry-backup-$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).tar.gz -C /data .
```

---

## Firewall Configuration

This setup uses standard HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) ports.

### Ubuntu/Debian (UFW)

```bash
# Allow HTTP and HTTPS
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp

# Enable firewall
sudo ufw enable
```

### Fedora/RHEL (firewalld)

```bash
# Allow HTTP and HTTPS
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https

# Reload firewall
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

---

## HTTPS Setup

**HTTPS is automatically configured during setup.** The setup script:
- Installs nginx as a reverse proxy
- Generates a self-signed SSL certificate (valid for 10 years)
- Configures nginx to redirect HTTP to HTTPS
- Exposes Foundry on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS)

### Self-Signed Certificates (Default)

The default setup uses self-signed SSL certificates, which provide encryption but will trigger browser security warnings.

**Pros:**
- Works immediately, no additional setup
- Free and automatic
- Perfect for local network use
- Provides encryption for sensitive data

**Cons:**
- Browser security warnings (need to click "Advanced" → "Proceed")
- Not trusted by browsers automatically
- Not suitable for public internet-facing servers

**Accept the certificate warning:**
1. Visit `https://yourserver.local`
2. Click "Advanced" or "More information"
3. Click "Proceed to yourserver.local (unsafe)" or "Accept the Risk"
4. The warning won't appear again on that device

### Using Your Own SSL Certificates (Optional)

If you have valid SSL certificates (e.g., from Let's Encrypt), you can replace the self-signed certificates:

1. Copy your certificates to the server:
```bash
sudo cp your-cert.crt /etc/nginx/certs/foundry.crt
sudo cp your-cert.key /etc/nginx/certs/foundry.key
```

2. Set proper permissions:
```bash
sudo chmod 644 /etc/nginx/certs/foundry.crt
sudo chmod 600 /etc/nginx/certs/foundry.key
```

3. Reload nginx:
```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### Obtaining Let's Encrypt Certificates

For a public domain with automatic certificate renewal:

1. Install certbot:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx

# Fedora
sudo dnf install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

2. Obtain certificate (requires domain pointing to server):
```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com
```

3. Follow the prompts. Certbot will automatically configure nginx and set up renewal.

**Note:** Let's Encrypt requires a public domain and port 80 accessible from the internet.

## Troubleshooting

### Containers Won't Start

**Check Docker daemon:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status docker
sudo systemctl start docker
```

**Check logs:**
```bash
./logs
# Or specific container
docker compose logs foundry

# Check nginx logs
sudo journalctl -u nginx -n 50
```

**Check disk space:**
```bash
df -h
```

### Can't Access Foundry

**Verify containers are running:**
```bash
docker compose ps
```

**Check firewall:**
```bash
sudo ufw status  # Ubuntu/Debian
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all  # Fedora/RHEL
```

**Test from server:**
```bash
# Test Foundry container directly
curl http://localhost:30000

# Test nginx HTTPS
curl -k https://localhost

# Check nginx status
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

**Check port binding:**
```bash
docker compose ps
# Look for "127.0.0.1:30000->30000" in output

# Check nginx is listening on 80/443
sudo ss -tulpn | grep nginx
```

### Permission Errors

**Docker permission denied:**
If you see "permission denied while trying to connect to Docker daemon":
```bash
# Add your user to the docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Log out and back in for changes to take effect
# Or run this to apply immediately (in current shell only):
newgrp docker

# Verify you're in the docker group
groups | grep docker
```

**nginx configuration permission denied:**
Make sure you have sudo privileges. Test with:
```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

**Fix data volume permissions:**
```bash
./stop
docker run --rm -v foundrydeploy_foundry_data:/data alpine chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) /data
./start
```

### Foundry Won't Download

**Symptoms:**
- Container keeps restarting
- 502 Bad Gateway when accessing Foundry
- Logs show "Unable to authenticate" or "Unable to log in"

**Cause: Invalid Credentials**

The most common cause is incorrect Foundry VTT account credentials in the `.env` file.

**Check credentials:**
```bash
# View current username (from FoundryDeploy directory)
grep FOUNDRY_USERNAME .env

# Check container logs for authentication errors
./logs
# Look for lines like "Unable to log in as username"
```

**Fix incorrect credentials:**
```bash
# Re-run setup to update credentials
./setup

# When prompted, enter your correct Foundry account credentials
# Then restart the containers
./start
```

**Verify your Foundry account:**
1. Log in to https://foundryvtt.com with your credentials
2. Verify your license is active and not expired
3. Ensure you're using your account email/username, not your license key
4. Check for any special characters in your password that might need escaping

**Still not working?**
- Try resetting your Foundry password at https://foundryvtt.com
- Make sure you don't have spaces before/after credentials in `.env`
- Check if you've hit the download rate limit (wait 15 minutes)

### Port Already in Use

**Find what's using ports 80 or 443:**
```bash
sudo lsof -i :80
sudo lsof -i :443
# Or
sudo ss -tulpn | grep :80
sudo ss -tulpn | grep :443
```

**Common conflicts:**
- Apache or other web servers
- Another nginx instance

**Solution:**
Stop the conflicting service:
```bash
# For Apache
sudo systemctl stop apache2

# For other nginx instances
sudo systemctl stop nginx
# Then run ./start which will restart nginx with Foundry config
```

### Docker Compose Command Not Found

**Check Docker Compose version:**
```bash
docker compose version  # v2 (plugin)
docker-compose version  # v1 (standalone)
```

**Install Docker Compose v2:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-compose-v2
```

### Out of Disk Space

**Clean up Docker:**
```bash
docker system prune -a
```

**Check volume size:**
```bash
docker system df -v
```

**Remove old backups:**
```bash
ls -lh backups/
rm backups/foundry-backup-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Running on Specific Network Interface

Edit `/etc/nginx/sites-available/foundry` to bind to a specific IP:
```nginx
server {
  listen 192.168.1.100:80;
  listen 192.168.1.100:443 ssl;
  # ... rest of configuration
}
```

Then reload nginx:
```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### Resource Limits

Limit CPU and memory usage in `compose.yml`:
```yaml
foundry:
  deploy:
    resources:
      limits:
        cpus: '2.0'
        memory: 2G
      reservations:
        memory: 1G
```

### Custom nginx Configuration

For more advanced reverse proxy features, edit `/etc/nginx/sites-available/foundry`. After making changes:
```bash
# Test configuration
sudo nginx -t

# Reload if valid
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

See [nginx documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/) for details.
